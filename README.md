# Data Loading and Preparation:

The code starts by importing necessary libraries: NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
It loads a dataset named "diamonds.csv" into a Pandas DataFrame called "diamonds."
A new column "Ratio" is created by dividing the "Price" column by the "Carat Weight" column.
Descriptive Statistics:

Calculates the average and standard deviation of the "Ratio" column in the diamonds dataset.
Prints out the average ratio and standard deviation.
Resampling and Confidence Interval:

A sample of 100 rows is randomly selected from the "diamonds" dataset.
Resampling is performed 5000 times, and the averages are stored in an array.
A histogram of the resampled averages is plotted.
A function for calculating confidence intervals is defined and applied, and the result is printed and plotted.
Hypothesis Testing:

Calculates the p-value and confidence percentage for the real ratio in the context of the resampling.
Determines if the real value is on the left or right side of the graph.
Prints the p-value and the percentage for the smallest confidence interval containing the diamonds' average ratio.
Linear Regression and Visualization:

Defines utility functions for standardizing units, computing regression data, residuals, and residual plots.
Applies these functions to a dataset "female_literacy_fertility.csv" and plots a scatter plot with a fitted line.
Model Evaluation:

Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
Calculates correlation, slope, intercept, and prediction function for the training set.
Compares the correlation, slope, and intercept between the full dataset and the training set.
Applies the trained model to the test set and evaluates the root mean squared error (RMSE) for both training and testing sets.
Results:

Prints correlation, slope, and intercept for the full dataset and the training set.
Prints the difference in correlation, slope, and intercept between the full dataset and the training set.
Displays a scatter plot with the fitted line for the training set.
Calculates and prints the RMSE for both the training and testing sets.
Prints the difference in RMSE between the testing and training sets.
The code encompasses data loading, descriptive statistics, resampling, hypothesis testing, linear regression, and model evaluation, providing a comprehensive analysis of two datasets.
